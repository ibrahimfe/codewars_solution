# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Codewars problems. Codewars is a platform that provides programming challenges (called "katas") to help developers improve their skills.

All of the solutions in this repository are written in Python.
## Getting Started

To run these solutions locally, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website.

Once you have Python installed, you can download the solutions from this repository using Git:

bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/codewars_solution.git

Then, navigate to the codewars_solution directory and run the Python files to see the solutions in action.
## Structure

The solutions are organized by difficulty level and kata name. Each kata has its own directory, which contains the solution file (solution.py) and any necessary input files.
